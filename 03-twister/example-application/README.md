# Zephyr Example Application

This project is based on https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/example-application.

It contains two custom boards called ``unleashed`` (a renamed version of Zephyr's ``hifive_unleashed`` target) and ``stm32f7`` (based on Zephyr's ``stm32f746g_disco``) and two samples, ``hello_world`` and ``shell_module``, copied here for convenience.
